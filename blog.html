                    <br>
                    I had a moment, that used to be my jam.
                    <br>
                    Recently my friends and I had a discussion about $ and relationships, co-habitation, Shacking up...
                    or
                    whatever the case may be. One important topic that was mentioned was the power of money in a
                    relationship
                    and how submission plays a large role in who provides what financially. I have heard many complaints
                    about
                    women not submitting to their loved one, or that women of this generation don't have the same values
                    as
                    they've once had. Women disrespect men, women cheat on men, women are so independent that they admit
                    to not
                    needing their man. I don't agree that a woman should talk down to her man, degrade him, make him
                    feel any
                    less of a man in this already jacked up society; especially a Black man.
                    <br>
                    Here is my opinion and I am not speaking on this as a female activist, or to attack men, but I do
                    believe
                    that it is harder for a woman to be submissive when she feels as though a portion of the bills fall
                    on her.
                    I am not speaking about accessories (I.E car note, Phone, Etc), I am speaking about rent and
                    utilities.
                    Personally, I do not mind helping with the bills, but I could understand how it can change the
                    nature of any
                    relationship. If a woman feels that she is partially responsible for the bills then she (naturally)
                    develops
                    this attitude of squalidness. She now believes that the two of them are on an equal playing field;
                    she
                    provides or contributes just as much as he does, so what makes him the "man of the house?"
                    <br>
                    In my opinion submission only comes when a woman feels that her man takes care of her 90% of the
                    time. I do
                    not believe a woman who is genuinely in love with her man develops this attitude willingly, it just
                    slowly
                    creeps its way into her bloodstream :)
                    <br>
                    Sometimes relationships go through rough-patches and at that time the woman should be able to help
                    pick up
                    the slack, but what usually happens is the man gets comfortable and things never return to normal.
                    <br>
                    To the men out there,
                    Let's face it... the more she pays, the less power you have.
                    <br>
                    Ultimately, a woman is going to find it hard to respect you if she's paying rent, and that also
                    gives the
                    man less power; money seems to be everything these days.
                    <br>
                    Money, power, and respect.
                    Help you sleep at night.
                    You'll see the light.
                    It's the key to life.
                    Money, power, and respect.
                    Whatchu' need in life.
                    Money, power, and respect.

                <h1>3rd Person</h1>

                <p>
                    Sitting here spending my planning period covering some other teacher's class who decided to call off
                    today.
                    Yea, when someone doesn't show up for work to teach, the whole team has to find a way to cover for
                    them and
                    that is of course because subs aren't interested in subbing anymore! I am tired...tired and even
                    more tired
                    than ever before. I play three roles everyday and I struggle with combining the three. I am a
                    teacher 1st
                    (which shouldn't be) because that prevails over everything else; I mean I can't even go get drunk
                    and fall
                    out on the sidewalk if I want to because I have to have "standards." Although, I am a bit too grown
                    to pass
                    out, and I'm not a spirits person. simply wine. Anyhow, I am "me" second, which is horrible because
                    as my
                    previous post stated, I don't even know myself. "Me" comes 2nd and I need to start putting myself
                    first.
                    Instead I do everything that everyone asks of me and then I am too tired to work on myself. For the
                    longest
                    time I have wanted to publish some of my works, but because I am so focused on trying to climb a
                    ladder at
                    my job (which is seeming unlikely) my potential gets swept under the rug. I've been struggling with
                    being me
                    and being a teacher. Although I'm still learning I have now come to the conclusion that "teaching"
                    is who I
                    am. I define a teacher, and not just by curriculum, standards, and state testing; I teach the youth
                    through
                    my wit, experience, and knowledge on living life as a Black woman. The "3rd me" is the girlfriend,
                    not much
                    to state here but the obvious, being a girlfriend means dealing with "me1" & "Me2," and still being
                    able to
                    balance the kind acts and words of affirmation that a women is supposed to provide for her man. Once
                    I get
                    home from playing my first two roles, role 3 comes off as exhausted and uninterested in much of what
                    my
                    partner has to say. I have not been a great companion these past couple months... life has taken
                    it's toll.
                    I am not sure which me I am supposed to focus more on. Do I let my job/passion consume my life, do I
                    leave
                    my personal dreams and let them continue to be just dreams, or do I denounce my future king and end
                    up a
                    lonely teacher?! Dating a teacher isn't the easiest task; could be better if maybe I was at a more
                    privileged school, but even then that would just create a "4th me." a "me" that I am not.

                    Finding myself.... still.

                <h1>Finding myself</h1>

                <p>
                    Sometimes I am not sure who I am or what my purpose is in life. Kind of late to be trying to figure
                    that out
                    isn't it?! I have been teaching for 6 years and sometimes I still struggle with the fact that this
                    is the
                    career I chose to be in for the rest of my life. Don't get me wrong, I love working with my young
                    scholars
                    in hopes that they find their treasures while helping me find mine. I have fought for so long
                    against the
                    career path that I chose because ideally I am not able to live the life I once dreamed of. It was
                    never
                    ideal for me to have to live check to check, choose between a vacation home to see my parents or
                    save my
                    sick days. One would say, "but you have summers off.: If I didn't have summers off I would go crazy.
                    The
                    only people who make comments like that are the people who don't appreciate that teachers are
                    raising their
                    kids all year long, now it's their responsibility to do so for only 2 months out of the darn year.
                    Being a
                    teacher is like having 100 kids pretty much take heed to you like your'e their mother for 10 months
                    straight, but somehow people seem to think that we teachers don't need a break from other peoples'
                    kids.
                    Anyhow sometimes I have a hard time dealing with the realization that I spent more on college than
                    my actual
                    degree pays a year. More and more I have grown to love my career and it is for that reason that I am
                    still
                    here. Trust me when I say, the 1st 5 years of teaching isn't spent teaching, but learning. I mean
                    physically
                    I was always teaching, but it wasn't until I buried myself in what I was teaching did I then learn
                    to
                    appreciate what it was that I was teaching. Now you can't tell me anything.

                    I'm just an educator praying to make it without the mental breakdowns, headaches, and taxed the hell
                    out of
                    paychecks.

                    I'm just trying to survive and still follow my dreams... Whatever they are!
