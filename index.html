            Salumu, the Universe responds to the name “I AM,” and “I AM DENATIA PALMER.” I am 32 years young, studious,
            and adventurous.
            My life revolves around the beauty of existence; a gift from God. Working with people is my passion, it
            allows me to share my joy and dreams in hopes of helping others find their aspirations. I hope to be a prime
            example of what any young woman can achieve. I am here to show them that “I AM WHO THEY ARE.”
            I have been through the storm and I am the rainbow that shines brightly after.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hailing from the first Historically Black College, I am a graduate of Lincoln University with a Bachelor’s
            degree in English Education;
            I am currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Curriculum & Instruction, which will in return allow me to
            educate and rehabilitate the community around me.
        </p>

            Adele is my great- grandmother and she was my rock. She was full of wisdom, and knowledge and those
            qualities were passed down to me. When she passed I made it a point to continue her legacy therefore I AM
            ADELE TREASURES. My treasures are those that have given me purpose in life; my students, family, and
            friends.
